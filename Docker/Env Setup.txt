=> Downloading the Docker Compose File
To download the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server Docker Compose file, run the following command:

=> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow/master/spring-cloud-dataflow-server/docker-compose.yml

=> If wget is unavailable, you can use curl or another platform-specific utility. Click here to download the docker-compose.yml file.

=> The Docker Compose file starts instances of the following products:

Spring Cloud Data Flow Server
Spring Cloud Skipper Server
MySQL
Apache Kafka

=> 
Starting Docker Compose
In the directory where you downloaded docker-compose.yml, start the system, by running the following commands:

COPY
export DATAFLOW_VERSION=2.4.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
export SKIPPER_VERSION=2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
docker-compose up
=> 
For Windows:
If you use Windows, you can define environment variables by using the set command. To start the system on Windows, enter the following commands:

COPY
C:\ set DATAFLOW_VERSION=2.4.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
C:\ set SKIPPER_VERSION=2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
C:\ docker-compose up

Spring Cloud Data Flow is ready for use once the docker-compose command stops emitting log messages.

=>
The docker-compose.yml file defines DATAFLOW_VERSION and SKIPPER_VERSION variables, so that you can easily change those values. The preceding commands first set the DATAFLOW_VERSION and SKIPPER_VERSION to use and then start docker-compose.

You can also use a shorthand version that exposes only the DATAFLOW_VERSION and SKIPPER_VERSION variables to the docker-compose process (rather than setting it in the environment), as follows:

DATAFLOW_VERSION=2.4.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT SKIPPER_VERSION=2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT docker-compose up

=> Stopping Spring Cloud Data Flow
When you want to shut down Spring Cloud Data Flow, you can use the docker-compose down command. To do so:

Open a new terminal window.
Change directory to the directory in which you started (where the docker-compose.yml file is located).
Run the following command:
DATAFLOW_VERSION=2.4.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT SKIPPER_VERSION=2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT docker-compose down
